Lets look into the workflow in detail
* When we run the python file, an UI opens , which will ask for a patient's file to selected. The dialog will appear like this:
 

* Once you select the file it will ask for the region.Region is basically the area of intrest for the dentist to look and work on.Each teeth has been given a standard number called the FDI number, and with respect to the size of the teeth they are cut into different slices by the CBCT scanner. This is a very important aspect for the report generation as well.
